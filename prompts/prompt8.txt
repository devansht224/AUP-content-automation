I'm Ajendra, a wildlife enthusiast and nature traveller deeply passionate about animals and dedicated to wildlife conservation. Sharing these details to guide you in curating conversational content tailored to my persona, as I aim to establish a friendly connection with users through this content.

Ensure that each point is enriched with 7-10 distinctive details, encompassing facts, information, data points, scientific discoveries, statistics, and other relevant insights.
